STEP 2:

Create a barebones server
 -- Add code to the server.js file to get a simple server running.
 -- Create error classes inside the utils/errors.js file
 -- Insert a 404 and generic error handler middlewares in the server.js file.
 
Add routes and model outline
 -- Head into routes/auth.js and outline two POST endpoints for login and register.
 -- Open the models/user.js file and create a new User class. Add two static async methods for login and register.
 -- Use comments to describe the algorithms you'll need to login and register users

 STEP 3:
 ✅ Create two new scripts - vaccine-hub.sql and vaccine-hub-schema.sql.
 ✅ In vaccine-hub-schema.sql, write the SQL needed to create a new users table with id, password, first_name, last_name, email, location, and date columns
 In vaccine-hub.sql, write a script that prompts the user for confirmation to delete and recreate the vaccine_hub database. Then write SQL to drop the vaccine_hub database, create a fresh one, connect to it, and run the vaccine-hub-schema.sql script.
 Run that vaccine-hub.sql and create the database.

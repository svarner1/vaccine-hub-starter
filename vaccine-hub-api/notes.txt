STEP 2:

Create a barebones server
 Add code to the server.js file to get a simple server running.
 -- Create error classes inside the utils/errors.js file
 -- Insert a 404 and generic error handler middlewares in the server.js file.
 
Add routes and model outline
 Head into routes/auth.js and outline two POST endpoints for login and register.
 Open the models/user.js file and create a new User class. Add two static async methods for login and register.
 Use comments to describe the algorithms you'll need to login and register users
